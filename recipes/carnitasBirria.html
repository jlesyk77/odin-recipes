    <p>You will first need a nice pork shoulder. I recommend at least a 3lb shoulder. (* As a side note: pork butt and pork shoulder as the same exact piece of meat so either will do!)</p>
    <p>Make sure to unwrap your shoulder from the butcher's twine and cover with mustard. Be generous enough to coat the entire shoulder, but, it doesn't need more than a thin-medium coating. This will only be used as a binder for your spice rub.</p>
    <p>Then add your spice dry rub. This can be anything you want, but for pork I highly recommend something that is heavy with a sugary-sweet element, something that has a lot of spice to balance the sweetness, and onion powder seems to be a great flavor to round out your spice rub. Of course you should also be using a mandatory of the 3 most basic ingredients (salt, pepper, and garlic powder).</p>
    <p>After this follow the short list of steps below to cook yourself delicioius carnitas birria!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Let the spice rubbed shoulder marinate for a minimum of 2 hours, up to 24 hours in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Take out the shoulder and place in slow cooker on low.</li>
        <li>Add 1-2 onions, quarted, a few cloves of garlic, and any other vegetables and herbs that you would like to flavor your shoulder with.</li>
        <li>Then add equal parts hot sauce and Coca-cola, making sure to only fill the cooker up 1-1.5 inches. The pork fat will render down and add to this braising liquid.</li>
        <li>Let cook on low heat for a minimum of 6 hours, up to 10-12 depending on size.</li>
        <li>After it's cook time, and the pork is beginning to shred effortlessly, turn your slow cooker off and unplug it.</li>
        <li>Allow the meat to rest in the covered slow cooker for a further 2-12 hours, depending on your personal preference. I like to time things so that the cook time ends as I'm going to sleep, and by the morning I wake up to the juiciest and most tender carnitas birria you've ever tasted.</li>
