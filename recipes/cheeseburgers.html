    <h3>Burger Sauce</h3>
    <p>First you need to make the burger sauce which is incredibly easy!</p>
    <p>Just mix the following list of ingredients together in the ratios listed and you'll have a delicious sauce to lather your burgers with!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 part Ketchup</li>
        <li>3/4 part Mayo</li>
        <li>1/4 part Mustard</li>
        <li>1/4 part Hot Sauce of choice</li>
        <li>1/4 part Worchestshire Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The <em>(Smash)</em>burgers</h3>
    <h5>Burger Ingredients:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>80% lean/ 20% fat ground beef</li>
        <li>Brioche buns</li>
        <li>American Cheese slices</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The next thing to do is to make your patties.</p>
    <p>It'll be easy to source the beef because you just need to use a 80/20 lean-fat ground beef.</p>
    <p>The patties should be made in 2.5 oz balls.</p>
    <p>Fire up a flat top grill as high as it will go and adequately grease it.</p>
    <p>Then follow the rest of the directions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>For each burger use 2 patties.</li>
        <li>Place both patties on the hot flat-top and press them down flat.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>After 1-2 minutes, as soon as the patty is fully browned on the bottom, flip each.</li>
        <li>Immediately put 1 slice of American Cheese on each patty.</li>
        <li>Place both patties on your brioche bun.</li>
        <li><strong>ENJOY!</strong></li>
    </ol>
